### Adding | Commiting | Pushing

### Always check status, Its a great habit
```
git status
```

### Anything after the add are going to be the file(s) you want to add. (* && . === all/everyting) else you have to specifically add the files. Be careful using the 'all'. Know what files have been changed with git status.
```
git add .
```

### Commit!
```
git commit -m"Your commit message"
```

### Make sure you are on the branch that has the features you want to push up.
```
git push origin $(current_branch)
```
